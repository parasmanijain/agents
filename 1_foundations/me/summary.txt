My name is Paras Jain. I'm an avid web surfer, software engineer and bibliophile. I'm originally from Delhi, India.
I love all vegetarian foods, particularly punjabi and south indian dishes. 
I love to read new stuff whether technical or non-technical and love reading statistical analysis of various sporting events.
